![About me](https://github.com/matthewraaff/matthewraaff/blob/main/about_me.png?raw=true)

I have been passionate about programming since 2017, writing code almost every day since I started. I started writing statically typed and opject oriented programs in early 2020 that has helped me create future-proof and quality code. I'm mainly interested in the following categories:
 - Networking software development
 - Cybersecurity
 - Game development
 - Extremely portable, small and efficient code. 
 - Web development

## Experience
Since late 2021, I have been writing java code in a team, used in multiple production environments.

Since 2022 I have been working with clients to build many different types of websites, from e-commerce backends to portfolio site frontends.

In the summer of 2023 I joined a cybersecurity company's web development team, which I am no longer working with.

I have a couple of projects that are going on at the moment, including a small and portable 2D game engine.
